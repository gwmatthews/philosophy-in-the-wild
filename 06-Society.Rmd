 <p>Cornel West is a thinker. Readers of Prospect magazine recently voted him the world's fourth-best thinker. And right now he is thinking about 3 November, and whether the United States will reject or endorse Donald Trump. No one knows what will happen; not even West, not least because in the US he sees contradictions that even he can't fully explain.</p>
