This project is open ended and this includes contributions. 
If you see fit to contribute in some way please do! Do check out the [code of conduct](https://github.com/gwmatthews/philosophy-in-the-wild/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which basically calls for this place to be welcoming, open and inclusive. 
Do keep in mind that philosophers tend to be argumentative. But they are, or should still be, kind.

Some particular ways to contribute are:
1. Write a section of an existing chapter. 1500 words is probably a range to shoot for. 
2. Add videos, multimedia, images (open source -- I'll add source recommendations).
3. Edit for style, readbability, accuracy, logic, evidence.
4. Add new chapters, sections, etc.
5. Fork and make it your own and share a link so I can see what you do!
6. Write documentation: there should be an appendix for how to make one of these books on your own.
7. Discuss things on the issues list.
