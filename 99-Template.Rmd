This is a template for writers of chapters. Each chapter consists of a single page like this and has three to five subsections. Open up the file 99-Template.Rmd and save it as a copy to create a new page. Then just replace this text with your own and follow the models for formatting images text boxes links and more.

**_Opening words of sentence_** gets highlighted and everything else is normal.




## Summary {-}

This is an embedded html slideshow. It is an iframe embed and so in principle anything could fit here. Have a look at the css to see the format trick for adjusting proportion to different media. Here the css class is "slideshow." Compare that class to the "video" class -- the principle is the same.

:::{.slideshow  data-latex="Here is a slideshow summary which can be \href{https://gwmatthews.github.io/ethics-slideshows/01-slides.html}{viewed online}, \href{https://gwmatthews.github.io/ethics-slideshows/pdf/01-slides.pdf}{downloaded} or \href{https://gwmatthews.github.io/ethics-slideshows/pdf/01-handout.pdf}{printed}."}

## Further exploration {-}

- Michael Sandel is a philosophy professor at Harvard who teaches a very popular course called "Justice" that explores material that overlaps with this text. His extensive website [Justice with Michael Sandel](http://justiceharvard.org/){target="_blank"} also has videos of his lectures from that course the first of which focuses on the famous runaway trolley example.
